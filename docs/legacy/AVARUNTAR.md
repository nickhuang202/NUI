# AVARUNTAR

**AVARUNTAR** stands for  
**Accton Versatile Automated RUN Testing And Reporting**

AVARUNTAR is an automated testing framework designed for the **Accton META project**, focusing on **end-to-end auto test execution, validation, and result reporting**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of AVARUNTAR is to:

- Provide a **reliable and repeatable auto testing system** for META-related platforms
- Reduce manual testing effort and human error
- Enable **continuous validation** during development, integration, and release phases
- Improve testing efficiency under **shared hardware resource constraints** (e.g. transceivers)

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Automated RUN Testing**
  - One-command execution for predefined test suites
  - Supports regression, sanity, and stress test scenarios

- **Validation & Reporting**
  - Structured test logs
  - Clear pass/fail summaries for each run
  - Ready for integration with internal reporting flows

- **Accton-Oriented Design**
  - Tailored for Accton META project requirements
  - Compatible with existing build and test environments

- **Extensible Architecture**
  - Easy to add new test cases or platforms
  - Designed for long-term maintenance and scalability

## 🧩 Typical Workflow

1. Prepare build image / test target
2. Trigger AVARUNTAR auto test
3. Execute validation test suites
4. Collect logs and results
5. Generate test report

## 📌 Naming Note

The name **AVARUNTAR** is a backronym created to emphasize:

- **Accton**
- **Automated Auto Testing**
- **RUN-based execution model**

It reflects the project's focus on automation, validation, and reliability for the META ecosystem.
